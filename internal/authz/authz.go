// Package authz models who is making a request and what they are allowed to
// touch. It is deliberately free of HTTP and storage dependencies so the
// rules can be read and tested on their own.
//
// The central idea is that there is always a principal. 3270Connect has two
// deployment shapes: a single operator on a laptop with no login, which is the
// default and stays the default, and a shared console where people sign in.
// Rather than branching between "no auth" and "auth" at every decision point,
// the single-operator shape is expressed as a principal too (see Local).
// Authorization logic then runs identically in both shapes, which means the
// default configuration exercises the same code the multi-user configuration
// depends on, instead of leaving that code untested until somebody turns it
// on.
