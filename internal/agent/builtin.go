// builtinFS carries the skills and instructions that ship with 3270Connect.
//
// Embedding them rather than installing them beside the binary means a bare
// download is complete: there is no state where the assistant is running but
// has no idea how to explore an application. Loose files and extensions layer
// on top, they do not replace this.
