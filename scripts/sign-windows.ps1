.SYNOPSIS
    Authenticode-signs Windows binaries with the project's code signing certificate.

.DESCRIPTION
    Wraps signtool.exe so that local signing and CI signing are the same code
    path. The certificate is read from the Windows certificate store, which is
    where Certum's SimplySign Desktop publishes a cloud certificate: it emulates
    a smart card reader, so a cloud-held key looks exactly like a local one to
    signtool. Nothing here is Certum-specific — a USB token or an imported .pfx
    presents the same way.

    Prerequisites when signing against Certum's cloud certificate:
      1. SimplySign Desktop is installed and logged in (the session lasts two
         hours, after which it needs a fresh token from the SimplySign mobile
         app).
      2. "Enable PIN cache for CSP/KSP-based applications" is ticked in
         SimplySign Desktop, otherwise every single file prompts for a PIN and
         an unattended run blocks forever on an invisible dialog.

.PARAMETER Path
    One or more files to sign. Globs are accepted.

.PARAMETER Thumbprint
    SHA-1 thumbprint of the signing certificate. Optional: when omitted the
    script picks the sole code-signing certificate in the store and fails if
    there is more or less than one, which is safer than silently signing with
    whichever certificate happened to sort first.

.PARAMETER TimestampUrl
    RFC 3161 timestamp authority. Timestamping is what keeps a signature valid
    after the certificate expires, so it is not optional here — a failure to
    timestamp fails the run.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/sign-windows.ps1 -Path dist/3270Connect.exe
