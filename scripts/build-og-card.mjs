/**
 * Render brand/og-card.html to the social preview PNG the site advertises in
 * its `og:image` / `twitter:image` tags.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm i playwright && npx playwright install chromium   # once
 *   node scripts/build-og-card.mjs
 *
 * Options (positional, all optional):
 *   node scripts/build-og-card.mjs <card.html> <out.png> <scale>
 *
 * `scale` is the device pixel ratio to capture at, default 2. The copy served
 * by the operations console is built at 1 — it ships inside the binary, and
 * 300 KB of retina detail is not worth carrying for a card that is only ever
 * posted into a team chat:
 *
 *   node scripts/build-og-card.mjs brand/og-card.html templates/static/images/og-image.png 1
 *
 * Why a script and not `chromium --headless --screenshot`: the plain CLI sizes
 * its capture from the *window*, not the viewport, and headless still reserves
 * space for the (absent) browser frame — a `--window-size=1200,630` run paints
 * a 1200x543 viewport into a 1200x630 image, so the bottom of the card comes
 * out blank. Playwright sets the viewport itself, which is the only way to get
 * exactly 1200x630 of card.
 *
 * The card is captured at deviceScaleFactor 2. The tags advertise 1200x630 and
 * that is the size every scraper lays out; the extra pixels exist so the type
 * stays crisp on the retina phone screens where most links are opened.
